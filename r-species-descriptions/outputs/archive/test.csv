Legs: coxae green, pro- and meso femora brown, hind femora blue-green, tibiae brown to yellow, lighter on distad and inner surfaces, tarsi yellow. Antenna: scape brown; pedicel brown; flagellum yellow. Head, in frontal view: quadrate, slightly wider than high, HW/HH 1.3; in dorsal view transverse, width greater than twice length, HW/HL 2.1-2.2; slightly wider than pronotum, HW/PW 1.1.-1.2. Frontal carina: absent. Scrobal cavity: shallow, with sides of scrobal cavity expanded. Ocelli: normal size, as wide or wider than F1. POL: long, a least twice OOL. Vertex: about one-third HL; conspicuously swollen ridge originating from between median and lateral ocelli towards lower eye margin; rounded behind, slightly invaginated towards median ocellus; interocellular region with alveolae around ocelli, with strong transverse costulae, uppermost costulae strongly curved towards median ocellus, without distinct posterior carina. Outer orbits, sculpture at mid-eye height: imbricate, stronger costulae behind. Inner orbits: in lateral view expanded, gradually narrowing from top to middle of eye; sculpture coriaceous. Malar space: about one-fifth eye height,  MS/EH approx. .2; malar sulcus distinct. Malar region, sculpture: glabrous, with weak piliferous puncta. Clypeus: transverse, much wider than high, CW/CH 2.1-2.2; lateral sulci strong and straight, strongly divergent; tentorial pits deep; epistomal sulcus deeper and more distinct than lateral sulci; straight or weakly concave; only slightly extended ventrad; lower margin convex, rounded; Supraclypeal area: longer, .6-.7 clypeus height; Female scape: long, about .6 EH; glabrous, without apical punctures; Pedicel: longer than F1, PL/F1L 1.3-1.7; Anellus: 0.5 F1L; Mesosoma in dorsal view (needs edit): about 1.1-1.2 maximum width; Pronotum in dorsal view: short, about one-quarter length of mesoscutum, PN/MSC .23-.26; shorter along midline, .7-.8 length laterad; anterior margin rounded, without a distinct edge; Lateral panel of pronotum (recode pappi collium): flat, with 2 rows punctures and coriarious patch with few rugae running between punctures, with flared margin; narrower than prepectus, LPN/PPT 0.6-0.7; Raised smooth transverse tubercle: present; Midlobe of mesoscutum (sculpture): with angulate punctures and narrow interspaces; Midlobe of mesoscutum (sculpture): with angulate punctures and narrow interspaces, widened on anterior median mesoscutum; notauli distinct; Lateral lobe of mesoscutum (sculpture): strongly coriaceous; weak rounded punctures, interstices wide, coriaceous, with few longitudinal rugae; with angulate punctures and narrow interspaces; Propodeum: long, length along midline about one-third width of propodeum; alveolate-rugose laterad, delimited ventrad by plicae, dorsad by transverse band of foveae and long median carina; Forewing with: postmarginal vein about 0.9-1 length of marginal vein; Petiole, with exposed dorsal suface: short and straplike, glabrous, light brown in colour, without raised dorsal surface; Gs1: not examined; acrosternite not examined; Gt2: glabrous, weakly concave; Gt3: glabrous;"
