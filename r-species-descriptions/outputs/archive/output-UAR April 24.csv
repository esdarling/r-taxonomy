Ocelli: large, wider than F1; POL very long, >2.5x OOL. rounded behind, thin and shallow longitudinal groove along costulae midline; shallow groove originating from median ocellus to posterior head margin, without distinct posterior carina; Outer orbits: weakly imbricate, stronger costulae behind; Inner orbits: in lateral view, parallel to inner eye margin; Malar space: short, about one-fifth eye height,  MS/EH approx. 0.2; Clypeus: transverse, wider than high, CW/CH approx. 1.7-1.8; lateral sulci weak and straight or weakly rounded, weakly divergent; tentorial pits distinct; epistomal sulcus straight or weakly concave, same strength as lateral sulci, only slightly extended ventrad; lower margin convex. Supraclypeal area: long, 0.7-0.8 clypeus height. Antenna: scape long, approx. 0.6 EH; without apical punctures; anellus short, AL/PL approx. 0.1; F1 subquadrate, shorter than pedicel. F2 transverse; Mesosoma: strongly elongate, length approx. 1.4 maximum width; in lateral view flattened; Pronotum in dorsal view: short, about one-quarter length of mesoscutum, PN/MSC 0.2-0.3; shorter along midline, 0.5-0.6 length laterad; anterior margin sharp, with distinct edge, the first row of puncture slightly lower. without flange on pronotal panel at the level of mesothoracic spiracle; Lateral panel of pronotum: flat, with 3 rows of punctures and coriaceous interspaces dorsad,  imbricate ventrad with 1 row of punctures at anterior margin; anterior margin slightly rounded; posterior margin ventrad deeply grooved, with row of alveolae; slightly wider than prepectus, LPN/PPT approx. 1.2-1.3. Prepectus: closely associated with pronotum; narrow, anterior margin slightly curved dorsad and obliterated by row of alveolae ventrad, posterior margin concave; Femoral depression: glabrous. raised smooth transverse tubercle absent; with large round punctures and wide interspaces, glabrous to weakly coriaceous along midline and coriaceous on periphery. Lateral lobe of mesoscutum: glabrous; small round punctures and wide coriaceous interspaces. Scutellum: about as long as mesoscutum, SC/MSC approx.1.1; posterior margin truncate; with round punctures and wide glabrous interspaces, coriaceous on periphery. Axilla: alveolate dorsad, imbricate laterad. Axillula: short and triangular, shorter than width at base, glabrous. Propodeum: length along midline about one-third width of propodeum; plicae obliterated laterad, delimited ventrad by plicae, dorsad by transverse band of foveae and median carina; glabrous to weakly imbricate, with weak groove along median carina; nucha coriaceous. Forewing: long postmarginal vein, 0.8-0.9 length of marginal vein, 1.4-1.6 length of stigmal vein. petiole short with glabrous to weakly coriaceous raised scale; Gt2: glabrous, posterior margin weakly concave at middle. Gt3: glabrous. Color(male): similar to female. Malar space(male): shorter. Scape(male): about 0.5 EH; elongate, length about >5x width above radicle; punctures covering about one-third of scape, PL/SL 0.3. Mesosoma(male): more elongate, length approx. 1.5 maximum width."
