auratus.2
"Length: approx. 2.5mm. Body color: iridiscent, head, pronotum, prepectus, and lateral sides of lateral lobes of mesoscutum gold and red, mesoscutum and scutellum red and black, rest of thorax blue-green or violet, gaster gold-green; raised smooth tubercle same color as mesoscutum; dorsellum band iridiscent blue. Legs: coxae, femora, and tibiae brown, lighter on distad and on inner surfaces, with weak violet reflections, stronger on hind femora, tarsi brown. Antenna: scape brown, females with weak iridescent reflections; pedicel brown; flagellum brown. Head, in frontal view: quadrate, slightly wider than high, HW/HH 1.2-1.3; in dorsal view transverse, width greater than twice length, HW/HL approx. 2.1-2.2; slightly wider than pronotum, HW/PW approx. 1.1.-1.2. Frontal carina: absent; Scrobal cavity: shallow, with sides of scrobal cavity expanded. Ocelli: small, about as wide as F1; POL long, a least twice OOL. conspicuously swollen ridge originating from between median and lateral ocelli towards lower eye margin; rounded behind; interocellular region weakly rugose, with strong transverse costulae, with distinct posterior carina. Outer orbits, sculpture at mid-eye height: glabrous, with strong costulae behind. Inner orbits: in lateral view expanded, gradually narrowing from top to middle of eye; sculpture glabrous, smooth and shining. Malar space: long, greater than one-quarter eye height, MS/EH approx.0.3; malar sulcus distinct. Malar region, sculpture: glabrous, with weak piliferous puncta. Clypeus: subquadrate, wider than high, CW/CH 1.9; lateral sulci weak and straight, strongly divergent; tentorial pits deep; epistomal sulcus deeper and more distinct than lateral sulci; concave; only slightly extended ventrad; lower margin convex, rounded. Supraclypeal area: longer, .6-.7 clypeus height. Female scape: long, about .6 EH; glabrous, without apical punctures. F1: longer than wide. Pedicel: longer than F1, PL/F1L approx. 1.3-1.7. Anellus: 0.3 F1L. Mesosoma in dorsal view (needs edit): approx. 1.1-1.2 maximum width; Pronotum in dorsal view: short, about one-quarter length of mesoscutum, PN/MSC .23-.26; shorter along midline, .7-.8 length laterad; anterior margin sharp, with a distinct edge. Lateral panel of pronotum (recode pappi collium): flat, with 3 to 2 rows punctures, with a angulate margin; without weak flange on pronotal panel at the level of mesothoracic spiracle; about as wide as prepectus, LPN/PPT approx. 1.0. Prepectus: broad, in form of isosceles triangle, well separated from pronotal panel; glabrous, with many small foveae along dorsal and posterior margins. Raised smooth transverse tubercle: present. Midlobe of mesoscutum (sculpture): with angulate punctures and narrow interspaces, widened and coriaceous on anterior mesoscutum. Lateral lobe of mesoscutum (sculpture): strongly coriaceous; weak rounded punctures, interstices wide, coriaceous, with few longitudinal rugae. Scutellum (length): equal in length to mesoscutum, SC/MSC approx. 1; with angulate punctures and narrow interspaces. Axilla (sculpture): densely alveolate dorsad, imbricate laterad. Axillula: short and triangular, only as long as width at base, glabrous. Propodeum: long, length along midline about one-third width of propodeum; alveolate-rugose laterad, delimited ventrad by plicae, dorsad by transverse band of foveae and long median carina; weakly imbricate, with weak foveae along thin median carina. Forewing with: postmarginal vein about 0.9-1 length of marginal vein. Petiole, with exposed dorsal suface: short and straplike, glabrous, light brown in colour, without raised dorsal surface. Gs1: not examined; acrosternite not examined. Gt2: glabrous, truncate, weakly coriaceous along midline, weakly imbricate laterad. Gt3: imbricate-punctuate dorsad and laterad, each puncture formed of two smaller punctures."
